# log_parser
To run this parser you MUST have java installed on your computer and run this from a terminal.
Run the command:
```
$ java -jar log_parser.jar /path/to/log/file
```
A tab delimited file -output.csv- will be created and the program will output a resume of the run, which looks like:
```
=======================
 total checkouts: 518
 total denied: 671
 total days on log: 43
